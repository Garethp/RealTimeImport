## Updating the Plugin

To upload the updated plugin to AnkiWeb, you just have to do the following:

 * Create a `.zip` file containing `__init__.py` and `RealTimeImport.py` in the root directory
   * If these files are put into a directory inside the zip, it will fail
 * Upload the `RealTimeImport.py` file alone as the `2.0` version
 * Upload the `zip` file as the `2.1` version
